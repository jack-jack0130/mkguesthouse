Remember to keep the structure simple and intuitive, ensuring visitors can easily find the information they need. Also, make sure to optimize the website for mobile devices as many travelers use their smartphones for bookings and research. As your hostel grows or based on specific features you want to emphasize, you can always modify or expand the tree structure accordingly.
